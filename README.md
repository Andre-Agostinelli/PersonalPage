TODO: 
1. Fix resizing issues of timeline svg on smaller viewwindows
    a. Parent div could make sticky so it has scroll behavior taking up more space too
2. Better space static skills to take up more of the about me section
    a. Possibly add more to about
3. Regular view window heeader text and header itself is too small, correctly enlarges on sm: however
4. Pad image better so hover doesn't clip header
